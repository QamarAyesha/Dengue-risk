# 🦟 AI-Driven Dengue Prevention System Ecosystem

A streamlit template for mapping applications. It can be deployed to [Streamlit Cloud](https://streamlit.io/cloud).

## 1. Input Data Layer (🔵 Data Sources)
🌧️ Weather & Environmental Data:

Rainfall, temperature, humidity (historical + real-time).

🛰️ NDVI (Vegetation Index) for stagnant water detection.

🦟 Historical Dengue Cases: Monthly cases by region (from Health Authority, WHO, local hospitals).

🔄 Feedback Loop: Symptom reports from the health staff and Hospitals to improve prediction

## 🧠 2. AI/Processing Layer (Core Intelligence)
Predictive Models:

Analyzes correlations between weather data & dengue cases.

Generates High-risk zone maps 🗺️ with risk scores.

Alert System: Triggers early warnings ⚠️ for health officials.

Fumigation scheduling optimized by AI.
