# 🦟 AI-Driven Dengue Prevention System 

## Our proposed solution
Our solution is an AI driven dengue prevention system that provides real time dengue risk assessment based on environmental data and satellite-based stagnant water detection. By identifying high-risk areas, authorities can allocate resources efficiently and implement preventive measures. Our web app includes a Fumigation tracker which allows mapping and monitoring of fumigation activities in real-time ensuring systematic mosquito control. Our platform also educates users regarding preventive measures, symptoms and common  to empower communities in the fight against dengue.

## Role of AI in our solution
AI model to predict dengue outbreaks and identify high-risk areas based on environmental data, satellite based stagnant water detection and historical cases trend.
AI-powered data analytics to track fumigation activities


## 1. Input Data Layer (🔵 Data Sources)
🌧️ Weather & Environmental Data:

Rainfall, temperature, humidity (historical + real-time).

🛰️ NDVI (Vegetation Index) for stagnant water detection.

🦟 Historical Dengue Cases: Monthly cases by region (from Health Authority, WHO, local hospitals).

🔄 Feedback Loop: Symptom reports from the health staff and Hospitals to improve prediction

## 🧠 2. AI/Processing Layer (Core Intelligence)
Predictive Models:

Analyzes correlations between weather data & dengue cases.

Generates High-risk zone maps 🗺️ with risk scores.

Alert System: Triggers early warnings ⚠️ for health officials.

Fumigation scheduling optimized by AI.

## 🖥️ 3. Application Layer (Action & Visualization)
Health Official Dashboard:

📊 Interactive risk maps 🗺️.

🦟 AI-powered fumigation planning.

📱 Dengue prevention tips & real-time alerts 🚨.

📍 Fumigation alerts & reporting symptoms.

🔄 Feedback Loop: User reports to enhance AI models, improving risk predictions.

## 🔗 4. Future Integrations (Expansion & Automation)
  Government Health APIs:
  Automated case reporting to health agencies.
  Weather/Satellite APIs:
  Real-time environmental data from OpenWeatherMap & Sentinel Hub.
